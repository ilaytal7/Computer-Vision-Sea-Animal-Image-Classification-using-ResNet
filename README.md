## 📌 Project Overview  
This project tackles **multi-class image classification** of sea animals using deep learning.  
The goal is to build a robust model that can correctly identify marine species such as whales, fish, turtles, eels, and corals — and evaluate performance using professional ML practices.  

The project demonstrates skills in **data preprocessing, augmentation, transfer learning, evaluation metrics, and visualization**, making it highly relevant for real-world AI applications.

## 📂 Dataset  
- Contains multiple classes of sea animals (fish, whales, corals, turtles, eels, etc.).  
- Images come in varied environments, lighting conditions, and angles, making the task non-trivial.  
- Below are a few **sample images from the dataset**:

## 🧪 Data Augmentation  
To **reduce overfitting** and **enrich the dataset**, multiple augmentation techniques were applied:  
- Random flips & rotations  
- Color jitter  
- Random cropping & resizing  
- Normalization  

These augmentations simulate real-world variability, improving the model’s ability to generalize.
